A FE demo for tech test.

I impletment this demo for tech test using ReactJS and Bootstrap.

Actually, I do not have reactjs knowledge and prefer to use AngularJS before I got this FE exam, but I saw "React is preferred.", I began to study and do prictice for ReactJs. After 2 days, complete, I think I have already had Reactjs ability.

We can use "npm start" command to check the website in node environment and under the project root folder.

The index.html is in the public folder and all js and css code are in the src floder.

I understand that there are still many problems in this demo, because I am still not familiar with the reactjs.

Introduction
Take a look at the following REST endpoints:

http://tempo-test.herokuapp.com/7d1d085e-dbee-4483-aa29-ca033ccae1e4/1/user/ http://tempo-test.herokuapp.com/7d1d085e-dbee-4483-aa29-ca033ccae1e4/1/team/

Append the IDs of users and teams to get further information about each entity, e.g.

http://tempo-test.herokuapp.com/7d1d085e-dbee-4483-aa29-ca033ccae1e4/1/user/15/ http://tempo-test.herokuapp.com/7d1d085e-dbee-4483-aa29-ca033ccae1e4/1/team/3/

This is the Teams REST service and it has a list of users, each user can be part of zero or more teams. Each team has one user as a team lead.

Main task
Build a UI showing all the teams, and allow the current user to navigate between teams to see each team's members.
What we are looking for:
Routing
Unit tests
State management (going full redux or similar is not necessary)
NOTE : The UI does not need to look good, unless you are applying for a more UI centric front-end developer role here at Tempo.

Must have
README.md : describing how you approach the problem and/or solution and most importantly how to run (best to keep it simple). If using a boilerplate (such as create-react-app) please denote where the most important pieces of code reside.

Code!! github url/tarball/zip/etc 

Restrictions

React is preferred.
